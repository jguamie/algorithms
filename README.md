# Preparing for the Google Coding Interview
Once it has been decided we are bringing you in for interviews, your interview performance is much more critical than your educational/work background. Based on interviews, we regularly hire engineers with no college degree and only a couple years of experience at ***a higher level*** than engineers with many years of experience and a master's degree in Computer Science.
## Important Note for Industry Hires
Your projects and work experience may develop your coding skills in various programming languages and object-oriented design. However, it will not be enough to be proficient in data structures and algorithms. Coding interviews are a learned skill. It requires a lot of practice and studying outside of your job responsibilities.
## Prerequisites
These prerequisites are for Java interviewees only. Move onto the next section if you're prepping with a different programming language. If you have not decided on a programming language yet, I strongly recommend Java. The most popular prep resources are written in Java.
* [Java Classes](https://github.com/jguamie/algorithms/blob/master/notes/java-classes.md)
* [Java Collections](https://github.com/jguamie/algorithms/blob/master/notes/java-collections.md)
## Practice
### Mock Interviews
Practicing with mock interviews is ***mandatory***. I cannot stress this enough. LeetCode is incredible but the actual coding portion of an interview should only be about 15 minutes of a 45-minute Google interview. You're spending a lot of time talking through potential solutions and trade-offs before you start coding. After you're done coding, you need to walk us through test cases. You will not pass a difficult Google-level coding interview without live interview practice and feedback.
If you are an experienced software engineer and a top performer at your current employer:
* At 20+ mock interviews, you have a very high chance of getting hired at L4+. At L5+, you are also required to succeed at [System Design interviews](https://github.com/jguamie/system-design).
* At 10- mock interviews, you're relying on a lot of luck. Even if you pass, you will most likely get hired at L-1.

Mock interview resources:
* [Technical Mock Interview](https://www.techmockinterview.com/)
  * This is a paid service with high quality interviewers from Google, Facebook, and Amazon with detailed verbal/written feedback and personalized coaching. I strongly recommend doing at least 10 mocks through here.
* [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/)
  * This is a free service. It is a hiring platform where it will connect you with potential employers if you pass enough interviews. The quality of feedback is poor in comparison to Technical Mock Interview.
* [pramp.com](https://www.pramp.com)
  * This is a free service. It is a peer-to-peer mock interview platform. Another great resource if you're trying to do as many mocks as possible.
* Friends and colleagues
  * Find other engineers to practice with. Start an interview club with your friends. Meet weekly to go through videos and coding exercises together.
* Mentor
  * Find a mentor. Reach out to other software engineers you respect. Ask them to meet with you regularly for mentoring sessions.
## Recommended Order of Study
### Big O
* For every algorithm, understand its time and space complexity (Big O) characteristics.
* [Chapter VI: Big O - Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
  * A lot of coding questions can be solved with various algorithms. Talking through the Big O of each is essential in trade-off discussions.
